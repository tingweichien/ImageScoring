# Image Scoring

## Intoduce

- Using the API from [Everypixel](https://labs.everypixel.com/api/docs) to build the GUI for multiple images scoring.

- Due to the fact that, I might waste an hour to decide which of the picture is better to upload which is really painful and annoying. Therefore, I want to utilize this API to build a GUI to help me out.

- The API provide by the [Everypixel] allows me to know which pictures get the better scores in different aspect, including
  - keywords
  - quality
  - quality_ugc
